# Pomodoro Timer

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer built using Python's Tkinter library. It helps users manage their time by following the Pomodoro technique, alternating between work and break sessions.

## Features

- 25-minute work sessions
- 5-minute short breaks
- 20-minute long breaks after every 4 work sessions
- Visual timer display
- Checkmarks indicating completed work sessions
- Start and reset functionality

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install tk
   ```
3. Place an image named `tomato.png` in the same directory as the script.

## Usage

Run the script using:

```sh
python pomodoro.py
```

## How It Works

- Click the "Start" button to begin a work session.
- The timer cycles through work and break sessions automatically.
